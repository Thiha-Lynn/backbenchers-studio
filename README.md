# Backbenchers Studio

An interactive Unity studio visit by Thomas D. Lynn. The welcome page and project stories load before the 3D engine; choose **Step inside** to explore.

- Drag to look; WASD or arrows to walk.
- Four numbered camera views provide a guided visit.
- Touch movement controls and a light quality preset support smaller screens.
- Selected work, profile, and portfolio links remain available without starting Unity.

## Release

Built with Unity 6000.7.0b2, with WebGPU preferred and WebGL2 fallback. Brotli builds use Unity's decompression fallback for GitHub Pages. `unity/build.json` maps the generated build files to the custom loader. GitHub Actions publishes only the site assets.

The editable Unity project is maintained locally as `BackbenchersStudio`. Its branded scene is `Assets/Backbenchers/Scenes/BackbenchersStudio.unity`. Use the **Backbenchers** editor menu to rebuild the scene and apply web settings, then build Web to this repository's `unity` directory. Run `python3 scripts/build-manifest.py` after a build. Authored Unity scripts are preserved in `Source/Backbenchers`; copy them into `Assets/Backbenchers` in a project containing your licensed original package and studio branding assets.

## Credits and rights
